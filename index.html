                    The mission will seek signs of habitable conditions on Mars in the ancient past, and will also search for evidence
                    or biosignatures of past microbial life, and water. The mission was launched 30 July 2020 on an Atlas V-541, and 
                    the Jet Propulsion Laboratory managed the mission. The mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program.The Science
                    Definition Team proposed that the rover collect and package as many as 31 samples of rock cores and surface soil for a later 
                    mission to bring back for definitive analysis on Earth.

                    The Perseverance rover will explore a site likely to have been habitable. It will seek signs of past life, set aside
                    a returnable cache with the most compelling rock core and soil samples, and demonstrate the technology needed for 
                    the future human and robotic exploration of Mars. A key mission requirement is that it must help prepare NASA for 
                    its long-term Mars sample-return mission and crewed mission efforts.The rover will make measurements and 
                    technology demonstrations to help designers of a future human expedition understand any hazards posed by Martian dust, 
                    and will test technology to produce a small amount of pure oxygen (O2) from Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2).

                        Ingenuity is a robotic helicopter that demonstrated the technology for rotorcraft flight in the extremely thin atmosphere 
                        of Mars. The aircraft was deployed from the rover's deck, and has flown five times during its 30-day test campaign early 
                        in the mission.
